    Integrate ART kernel contributions for one patch.

    This traces two ray bundles from uniformly sampled surface points on all
    triangles that form the patch: (1) a hemisphere bundle aligned with the
    patch normal and (2) its specularly reflected counterpart. For each
    sample point, rays are traced, hits are tallied per target patch, and
    accumulators are updated for distances, departure cosines, and specular
    pair counts. The index of the source patch is returned so that results
    from multiprocessing can be re-associated (return order isn't guaranteed).

    Parameters
    ----------
    args : tuple
        Expected layout:
        (mesh, num_patches, this_patch, patch_triangles,
         rays_per_hemisphere, points_per_square_meter)

        - mesh : TriangleMesh
          Mesh defining the environment geometry.
        - num_patches : int
          Total number of patches in the mesh.
        - this_patch : int
          Index of the source patch to integrate.
        - patch_triangles : sequence of int
          Triangle indices that belong to this source patch.
        - rays_per_hemisphere : int
          Number of rays shot per surface sample point.
        - points_per_square_meter : float
          Surface sampling density used to generate sample points.

    Returns
    -------
    cum_distances
        1D array of size num_patches with summed hit distances from this
        source patch to each target patch.
    cum_cosines
        1D array of size num_patches with summed departure cosines for rays
        originating on this source patch and hitting each target patch.
    cum_num_hits
        1D array of size num_patches with the number of ray hits per target
        patch, combining hemisphere and specular rays from all sample points.
    cum_specular_kernel
        2D array of shape (num_patches, num_patches) with counts of specular
        ray pairings: entry (h, j) counts pairs where a hemisphere ray from
        this source hits j and its specular counterpart hits h.
    num_points
        Total number of surface sample points used on this source patch.
    this_patch
        The source patch index, returned to reconnect unordered results.

    Build ART kernels and per-frequency-band reflection matrices for an environment.

    Depending on the presence of prior outputs and the overwrite flag, either
    reuse existing core ART files (diffuse/specular kernels, path indexing,
    lengths, and etendues) or compute them by integrating over patch surfaces.
    Path delays are computed from lengths using the speed of sound. For each
    frequency band in the loaded material data, a complete reflection kernel
    is assembled by weighting the diffuse and specular components by scattering,
    applying surface absorption, and applying air absorption along paths. All
    outputs are written to the given folder.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder_path
        Path to the environment folder.
    overwrite
        If True, compute core ART files even if they already exist.
    area_threshold
        Optional patch-area simplification threshold applied when loading inputs.
    thoroughness
        Optional remeshing effort parameter applied when loading inputs.
    points_per_square_meter
        Surface sampling density used to integrate each patch.
    rays_per_hemisphere
        Number of rays traced from each surface sample point.
    multiprocess_pool_size
        Number of worker processes to use (1 disables multiprocessing).
    humidity
        Relative humidity (%) used for air absorption.
    temperature
        Air temperature (deg C) used for air absorption and sound speed.
    pressure
        Atmospheric pressure (kPa) used for air absorption.

    Returns
    -------
    folder_path
        The (possibly updated) environment folder path.

    Notes
    -----
    If `area_threshold > 0`, this may write a simplified mesh to a different folder.
