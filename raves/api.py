    """
    Run the full RAVES pipeline in a given environment folder.
    This builds the ART model and immediately performs MoD-ART.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder_path : str
        Path to the environment folder, or a string like "all_examples". In the
        latter case, process all subfolders in "example environments" using the
        given parameters for all runs. Also accepts: "all_AudioForGames",
        "all_DampenedMiddle", "all_Museum"; each of these processes one subset
        of the example environments.
    overwrite : bool, default: False
        If True, any existing ART kernels are re-computed and overwritten.
        Otherwise, existing geometrical data is re-used, whereas material
        properties (and air absorption parameters) are read again and replaced.
    skip_ART : bool, default: False
        If True, skip the ART pre-processing stage and run only MoD-ART.
    skip_MoDART : bool, default: False
        If True, run only ART and skip MoD-ART.
    area_threshold : float, default: 0.0
        Minimum patch area (square meters) used to optionally simplify the mesh.
        Values > 0 may cause a simplified mesh to be written to a new folder.
        The path returned by `compute_ART` is then propagated to `compute_MoDART`.
    thoroughness : float, default: 0.0
        Effort/speed trade-off factor for remeshing (higher is more thorough).
    points_per_square_meter : float, default: 30.0
        Surface sampling density used during ART.
    rays_per_hemisphere : int, default: 1000
        Number of rays cast from each sample point during ART.
    multiprocess_pool_size : int, default: 4
        Number of worker processes to use. Use 1 to disable multiprocessing.
    humidity : float, default: 50.0
        Ambient relative humidity (%).
    temperature : float, default: 20.0
        Ambient temperature (°C).
    pressure : float, default: 100.0
        Ambient pressure (kPa).
    T60_threshold : float, default: 1e-1
        Threshold used during decomposition; the processing of each band
        halts if an energy mode is found to have T60 below this value.
    max_slopes_per_band : int, default: 10
        Threshold used during decomposition; the processing of each band
        halts if more than this many energy modes have been found.
    echogram_sample_rate : float, default: 5e3
        Sample rate (Hz) in the decomposed ART model.
        NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH AN AUDIO RATE.
    skip_T60_plots : bool, default: False
        If True, suppress generation of T60 plots by `compute_MoDART`.

    Returns
    -------
    None
        Outputs are written to `folder_path` (or a new path if a simplified mesh
        is produced) following the specifications outlined in `README.md`.

    Notes
    -----
    If `skip_ART` is False and `area_threshold > 0`, `compute_ART` may write
    a simplified mesh to a different folder and will return that new path;
    this function forwards that path to `compute_MoDART` to keep outputs consistent.
    Avoid using `area_threshold > 0` and `folder_path == all_examples`!
