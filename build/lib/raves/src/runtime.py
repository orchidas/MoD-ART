    Trace rays from one position and gather them into propagation paths.

    This traces a ray bundle from the given position, over a full sphere of
    directions. For each traced ray, the closest surface patches in the front
    and back directions are found and used to determine the index of the
    propagation path that the ray falls into. Distance to the patch in front
    is also used to determine the propagation delay of the ray hit.
    All of this is accumulated into a (sparse) 2D array of dimensions
    (number of paths X samples in time), where each element states how many
    rays fell into each propagation path at each moment in time. The array is
    normalized by the total number of rays, such that it sums to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh: TriangleMesh
        Mesh defining the environment geometry.
    path_indexing: scipy.sparse.csr_array
        Sparse 2D array relating each pair of surface patch indices to the
        index of a propagation path.
    position: numpy.ndarray
        3D coordinates of a single point in space (origin of the rays).
    overwrite: bool
        If True, perform the ray-tracing even if results already exist.
    echogram_sample_rate: float
        Sample rate used to discretize the propagation delays.
    num_rays: int, default: 1000
        Number of directions uniformly sampled on the sphere.
    output_file_path: str, default: None
        If not None, tracing results are saved to this file (should have `.mtx`
        extension). If `overwrite` is False and the file already exists,
        results are loaded without performing any tracing.
    humidity : float, default: 50.0
        Relative humidity (%) used for speed-of-sound computation.
    temperature : float, default: 20.0
        Air temperature (deg C) used for speed-of-sound computation.
    pressure : float, default: 100.0
        Atmospheric pressure (kPa) used for speed-of-sound computation.

    Returns
    -------
    contributions: scipy.sparse.csr_array
        A csr_array of shape (N, M), where N is the number of propagation paths
        and M is the time delay (in samples) of the latest contribution.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The results are dependent on the selected sampe rate, which needs to be
    compensated when building echograms. Consider specifying the sample rate
    in the name of the file or directory.
    
    The output array, being in CSR format, allows easy access to individual
    "filters" in the operator. See `operator_value_at_z()` for an example.
    
    Air absorption is not accounted for. The air parameters are used only to
    compute the speed of sound.

    Build echograms using MoD-ART.

    Depending on the presence of prior outputs and the overwrite flag, either
    reuse existing ray-tracing results or compute them.
    The ray-tracing results are used to generate operators which inject and
    detect energy in the propagation paths. These are converted into residues,
    and the echograms are built as sums of weighted slopes.
    Modal parameters, including the residue components, are also returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    folder_path: str
        Path to the environment folder.
    source_positions: numpy.ndarray
        Position(s) of the sound source(s). May have shape (N, 3) or just (3,).
    listener_positions: numpy.ndarray
        Position(s) of the listener(s). May have shape (N, 3) or just (3,).
    overwrite_sources: bool, default: False
        If True, compute ray-tracing from sources even if data already exists.
    overwrite_listeners: bool, default: False
        If True, compute ray-tracing from listeners even if data already exists.
    avoid_saving_residues: bool, default: True
        If True, always compute resiudes on the fly
        (they're usually more memory-expensive than compute-expensive).
    echogram_sample_rate: float, default: 5e3
        Sample rate in Hz used to quantize propagation delays.
    echogram_duration: float, default: 1.0
        Duration of the produced echograms, in seconds.
    num_rays: int, default: 1000
        Number of rays traced from each position.
    output_folder_path: str, default: None
        Path to the folder where ray-tracing results are saved (if provided).
        Specifying this is recommended to avoid repeated operations.
    humidity : float, default: 50.0
        Relative humidity (%) used for speed-of-sound computation.
    temperature : float, default: 20.0
        Air temperature (deg C) used for speed-of-sound computation.
    pressure : float, default: 100.0
        Atmospheric pressure (kPa) used for speed-of-sound computation.

    Returns
    -------
    echograms
        An array of shape (S, L, B, T) where:
        - S is the number of sources (even if only one is given);
        - L is the number of listeners (even if only one is given);
        - B is the number of frequency bands;
        - T is the duration of the echograms in number of samples.
    frequencies: numpy.ndarray
        The center frequency of each band.
    MoDART_data: dict
        A dictionary containing the following NumPy arrays:
        - 'Band idx', shape (M,): integer index of each mode's frequency band.
        - 'T60', shape (M,): T60 of each mode.
        - 'V_hat', shape (M, N): right eigenvector of each mode.
        - 'W_hat', shape (M, N): left eigenvector of each mode.
        - 'Source residues', shape (S, M): source residues components.
        - 'Listener residues', shape (L, M): Listener residues components.
