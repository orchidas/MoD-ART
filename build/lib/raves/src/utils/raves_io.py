    Merge coplanar, same-material patches whose areas are below a threshold.

    Patches are grouped by material, boundary edges are identified per patch,
    and a patch-adjacency graph is built where edges connect coplanar patches
    that share at least one edge. Within each connected component, clusters
    (sets of patch ids) are iteratively merged until all active clusters meet
    the area threshold or no eligible merges remain.

    Merge candidates are scored using:
    - new_range: range of cluster areas after the merge,
    - new_max: maximum cluster area after the merge,
    - compactness: merged area divided by estimated perimeter length.

    A soft selection controlled by ``thoroughness`` (clipped to [0, 1]) narrows
    the candidate set on each score in turn, and the best remaining merge is
    applied greedily.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices : (V, 3) ndarray of float
        Vertex coordinates of the mesh.
    vert_triplets : (T, 3) ndarray of int
        Triangle vertex indices (0-based) for the mesh.
    mesh : TriangleMesh
        Mesh structure; ``mesh.patch_ids`` provides per-triangle patch ids and is
        updated in place to reflect merges.
    patch_materials : list of str
        Per-patch material names. This list is modified in place by removing
        entries for merged-away patches and keeping the first id of each merge.
    area_threshold : float
        Minimum desired area per patch. Clusters with area below this value
        are candidates for merging.
    thoroughness : float
        Controls the softness of candidate filtering in [0, 1]; higher values
        keep more candidates during the staged filtering.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Notes
    -----
    - ``patch_materials`` and ``mesh.patch_ids`` are modified in place.
    - Coplanarity is checked using triangle normals and plane offsets from
      the provided ``mesh``.
