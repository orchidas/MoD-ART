    """
    Construct the sparse state transition matrix for an FDN-like system.

    Given an N x N feedback matrix and N integer delay lengths `m` (each
    at least 3), this builds the state transition matrix (size sum(m) x sum(m))
    that advances all inner states by one sample and feeds the last samples
    through the feedback matrix and then into the first samples.

    Two assembly modes are supported:
    - element_wise_assembly=True: set individual nonzeros directly in a LIL
      matrix and convert to CSR (fast and memory-friendly for large N).
    - element_wise_assembly=False: assemble using block matrices:
        * U_i: shifts inner samples of line i (shape (m_i-2, m_i-2))
        * R_i: shifts the first sample to the second (shape (m_i-2, N))
        * P_i: shifts the last sample into the first (shape (N, m_i-2))
        * feedback matrix: couples last to first samples across lines
    The latter assembly mode is included to intuitively match the definition
    shown in our papers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    kernel : scipy.sparse.csr_array
        Feedback matrix of shape (N, N), where N == len(m).
    m : array_like of int
        Per-line integer delay lengths; each m_i must be >= 3.
    element_wise_assembly : bool, default True
        If True, assemble by writing individual entries.
        If False, assemble from sparse blocks.

    Returns
    -------
    csr_array
        Sparse state transition matrix of shape (sum(m), sum(m)).

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError

    """
    Find real, positive eigenpairs of a sparse state matrix. Left and right
    eigenvectors are found separately, linked in pairs, and calibrated.

    Performs a shift-invert Arnoldi search (sigma=1) for right eigenpairs of
    the state transition matrix, filters to real positive eigenvalues (by
    bounding the imaginary part to `imaginary_part_thresh`), and stops when:
      1) at least one valid eigenvalue has T60 <= `T60_thresh`, or
      2) at least `num_thresh` valid eigenvalues have been found, or
      3) the search size reaches dim-2 (max allowed by Arnoldi), or
      4) convergence fails.

    The search is then repeated on the transposed matrix to obtain left eigenpairs,
    which are matched to their right counterparts by nearest eigenvalue, discarding
    unmatched pairs. Finally, each left/right pair is calibrated to have unity dot
    product, as discussed in `ART_theory.md`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ssm : scipy.sparse.csr_array
        Square sparse state transition matrix.
    T60_thresh : float
        Target magnitude threshold for early stopping. Search stops once any
        valid eigenvalue has T60 <= this value.
        Set to None to deactivate this stopping criterion.
    num_thresh : int
        Target count threshold for early stopping. Search stops once at least
        this many valid eigenvalues are found.
        Set to None to deactivate this stopping criterion.
    imaginary_part_thresh : float, default 1e-7
        Maximum absolute imaginary part for an eigenvalue to be treated as real.

    Returns
    -------
    numpy.ndarray
        Real eigenvalues (shape (K,)). Values are the average of matched left
        and right eigenvalues.
    numpy.ndarray
        Right eigenvectors (shape (M, K)), columns correspond to eigenvalues.
    numpy.ndarray
        Left eigenvectors (shape (M, K)), columns correspond to eigenvalues.

    Notes
    -----
    - The search size `k` starts at `num_thresh` and doubles up to dim-2.
    - Validity requires positive real part and small imaginary part (as set
      by `imaginary_part_thresh`).
    - Returned count K equals the number of matched valid eigenpairs; it may
      be less than the number initially found on either side.
